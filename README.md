# Context-Aware Kitsune IDS
![Architecture](architecture.png)
Context-Aware Kitsune IDS is a research implementation of an intrusion detection pipeline that extends Kitsune-style online anomaly detection with contextual risk assessment, adaptive decision thresholds, attack classification, and actionable counterfactual explanations.

The project integrates anomaly detection, contextual analysis, adaptive decision making, and explainable AI techniques to improve the interpretability and operational relevance of network intrusion detection systems.

# Research Motivation

Traditional network intrusion detection systems often rely on anomaly scores or classification labels alone. However, an anomaly score does not always represent the real operational risk of a network event.

The same anomaly score may require different responses depending on:

- Traffic behaviour and context.
- Historical network profiles.
- Risk level of the detected event.
- Cost of false positives and false negatives.

This project investigates a context-aware IDS pipeline that transforms raw anomaly signals into explainable and policy-aware security decisions.

```

The system follows a multi-stage decision process:

1. Network traffic is processed through Kitsune-style online anomaly detection.
2. Contextual features and behavioural profiles are extracted.
3. Risk assessment adjusts the interpretation of anomaly scores.
4. Adaptive thresholds improve detection under changing traffic conditions.
5. The decision layer determines the final security action.
6. Explanation modules generate interpretable reasons for detected events.
